# P6 Verification: Integration & Consistency Check

**Status**: COMPLETED

## Overview

P6 involved verifying that all Milestone 1 components work together consistently and provide a coherent path to implementation.

## Verification Criteria

- [x] All documents consistent with each other
- [x] Probe results align with compatibility matrix
- [x] Design brief references matrix findings
- [x] Implementation path is clear and consistent
- [x] No contradictions between deliverables

## Implementation Status

### Document Consistency

- **Compatibility Matrix** ↔ **Design Brief**: Priority levels and features align
- **Specifications** ↔ **Matrix**: Function signatures and addresses consistent
- **Probe Results** ↔ **Matrix**: Evidence properly integrated
- **README** ↔ **All Docs**: Status accurately reflects completion

### Probe-Matrix Alignment

- **Hardhat Results**: CALL_EXCEPTION errors properly documented
- **Foundry Results**: Expected failures correctly categorized
- **0x7e Results**: Partial support accurately reflected
- **Error Details**: Specific messages captured and documented

### Implementation Path Consistency

- **P0 Priority**: Clear identification of critical features
- **Technical Approach**: Hardhat plugin vs Foundry extension consistent
- **Configuration**: Chain ID, fee models consistently defined

### Cross-Reference Validation

- **Method Selectors**: Consistent across all documents
- **Addresses**: 0x64 and 0x6C consistently referenced
- **Function Names**: Standardized across specifications
- **Priority Levels**: P0, P1, P2 consistently applied

## Evidence Files

- All documents cross-reference correctly
- Probe results properly integrated into matrix
- Implementation path is coherent and actionable

## Test Results

**Status**: COMPLETED

- All documents are internally consistent
- Cross-references are accurate and helpful
- Implementation path is clear and coherent

## Issues Found

None - P6 implementation shows excellent consistency and integration

## Verification Result

**P6: COMPLETED** - All M1 components work together consistently
